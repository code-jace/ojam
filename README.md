to whoever stumbles across this....
This was my final year project for a college course that did not teach me programming. I went off on a tangent and *badly* created this.
I finished college and somehow got a job with computers. I have since gotten better at web apps and the likes and am still passionate about the idea and concept of this project, so I have started a second improved version. 
That can be found [here](https://github.com/code-jace/ojam2).
I have no idea how to get this original version running, other than with an old node install and the original modules on my brothers macbook - so this is a fresh attempt at the same idea. It will be bigger and better than before (easily).
